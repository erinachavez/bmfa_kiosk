# [Boston Museum of Fine Arts Kiosk](https://erinachavez.github.io/bmfa_kiosk/)

This project is a prototype kiosk display for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, built under the direction of a museum studies graduate student. It was a fairly quick project from start to end, but conveyed clearly the intention of the kiosk, uses, and future possibilities for improvements. I'm proud to have contributed to this project!
